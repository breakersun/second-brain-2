 * the free plan, maintenance already spends about 30 of them, and accrual needs
 * about 34 on its own (see src/insight/candidates.ts's ACCRUAL_SEED_LIMIT
 * comment for the measurement).
 *
 * These strings must match wrangler.jsonc exactly. test/unit/cron-triggers.test.ts
 * fails if they drift.
